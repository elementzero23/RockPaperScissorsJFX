# RockPaperScissorsJFX

This simulates rock paper scissors by creating multiple instances inside a JavaFX stage. Whenever two tokens intersect, they compete with each other according to rock paper scissors rules. The simulation stops when there is onle one type left.

I used the Apple Color Emoji font because I had it already installed.

To start run the `main` method inside `GraphicalVisualizer` class.

## TODO:
 - adjust speed on the gui
 - dialog to enter number of tokens on the gui

## Screenshots:
